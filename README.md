# SEO Traffic Calculator

The SEO Traffic Calculator is a simple web tool that estimates the monthly visits a keyword may receive on Google. It uses the keyword’s monthly search volume along with position-based click-through rates (CTR) to give an approximate traffic value for different ranking positions.

## Why I Created This Tool

I built this tool to help digital marketers, SEO professionals, and website owners quickly assess the potential traffic impact of ranking on the first page of search results. By using real-world CTR data, the calculator offers a clear way to understand the value of ranking improvements for specific keywords.

## How to Use It

1. **Enter Monthly Search Volume:**  
   Input the keyword's monthly search volume in the designated field.

2. **Select Ranking Position:**  
   Choose the desired ranking position from the dropdown menu. Each option includes a preset CTR value based on current industry data.

3. **Calculate Traffic:**  
   Click the "Calculate Traffic" button. The tool uses the formula:  
   `Estimated Traffic = Monthly Search Volume × (CTR / 100)`  
   The result displays the estimated number of visits per month.

## What It's Useful For

- **SEO Strategy Planning:**  
  Determine which keywords offer the best traffic potential based on ranking improvements.

- **Traffic Forecasting:**  
  Estimate how much organic traffic you could attract, helping in decision-making and goal setting.
